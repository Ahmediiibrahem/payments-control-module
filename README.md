# Payments Control Module

Internal web-based module for **controlling cash requests, payments, and email follow-ups**, built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Google Sheets (CSV)**, and deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

## Overview

The module is designed to give **full visibility and control over cash exposure** inside the organization by:

- Tracking payment requests and transfers
- Analyzing email-based payment follow-ups
- Monitoring remaining cash exposure
- Providing executive insights (SLA, aging, bottlenecks)
- Allowing drill-down from summary → email → row level
- Restricting access through a simple login page

The system is **frontend-only**, with no backend or database.
